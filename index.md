# Welcome to my website!

My name is Xin Di (邸新 in Chinese). I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology. My research interest is mainly on understanding of brain connectivity and brain network organizations using brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I develop computational models to measure brain connectivity in different mental conditions, such as during cognitive tasks and watching movies. I am also interested in applying the methods to understand brain development and aging, as well as mental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 

I am currently an Associate Editor for Frontiers Brain Imaging Methods section after I have served for five years as a Review Editor. Over the past 10 years, I have reviewed more than 170 papers for scientific journals, including Nature Communications, GigaScience, Cerebral Cortex, Neuroimage, Human Brain Mapping, Scientific Data, Neurobiology of Aging, PLOS Computational Biology,  Neuroinformatics, and many more. I have been awarded as Top reviewers in Neuroscience by Publons in 2016, 2017, and 2018. 

For more about me, please see my CV.

# News
* July 24, 2020: Our latest paper is finally out after almost two years of review process. In this paper, we explained the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) method and its relation to beta series correlation.
* March 31, 2020: I become an Associate Editor for Frontiers Brain Imaging Methods section. See my Frontiers editorial contributions here.

Here I post some codes that were used in our published studies. 

### Codes for Di and Biswal (2017) in Front Neurosci
It contains the codes for simulation of the correlations of PPI (psychophysiological interaction) between two different ways of calculations, and the codes for calculating coefficient of variation using Bland and Altman's method (Bland and Altman, 1996). THe codes are available from this [project](https://github.com/dixy0/PPI_correlation_demo)

### Codes for Di and Biswal (2017) in Cereb Cortex
It contains the codes for PPI (psychophysiological interaction) and beta series analyses on several large scale functional MRI data. The codes are available from [Open Science Framework](osf.io/dka6g)
