## A list of my shared codes


### Codes for Di and Biswal (2017) in Front Neurosci
Some codes for simulation of the correlations of PPI (psychophysiological interaction) between two different ways of calculations.
And codes for calculating coefficient of variation using Bland and Altman's method (Bland and Altman, 1996).

### Codes for Di and Biswal (2017) in Cereb Cortex
