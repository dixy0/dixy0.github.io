## A list of my shared codes

Here I post some codes that were used in our published studies. 

### Codes for Di and Biswal (2017) in Front Neurosci
It contains the codes for simulation of the correlations of PPI (psychophysiological interaction) between two different ways of calculations, and the codes for calculating coefficient of variation using Bland and Altman's method (Bland and Altman, 1996). THe codes are available from this [project](https://github.com/dixy0/PPI_correlation_demo)

### Codes for Di and Biswal (2017) in Cereb Cortex
It contains the codes for PPI (psychophysiological interaction) and beta series analyses on several large scale functional MRI data. The codes are available from [Open Science Framework](osf.io/dka6g)
